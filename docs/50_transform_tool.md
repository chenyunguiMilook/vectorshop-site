# Transform Tool

## Selection

- Click on a layer object to select it. Click and drag on a blank area of the canvas to select multiple layers.
- Hold **⇧ Shift** and click a layer:
  - If the layer is already selected, it will be deselected.
  - If the layer is not selected, it will be added to the selection.
- Hold **⌘ Command** to ignore the layer hierarchy during selection.

## Transformations

### Move

- If no layer is selected, click and drag a layer to move it.
- If a layer is selected, hover the mouse inside the object boundary. The cursor will change to a move icon. Click and drag to move the layer.
- Hold **⌥ Option** while dragging to duplicate and move the layer. The cursor will change to indicate duplication.

### Rotate

  - Hold **⌥ Option** to scale from the object’s center.
  - Hold **⇧ Shift** to scale non-proportionally, using the opposite corner as the pivot.

  - Hold **⌥ Option** to scale from the center.
  - Hold **⇧ Shift** to scale proportionally using the opposite corner as the pivot.

### Skew

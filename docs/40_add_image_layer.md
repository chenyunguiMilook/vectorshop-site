# Adding Image Layers

## Adding

- Drag and drop an image onto the canvas to add it as an image layer.

## Editing

- After selecting the image layer, you can adjust the **Image Scale** property in the properties editor on the right.
  - For example: If the imported screenshot is a 2x image, you can set the image scale to **50%** for better reference purposes.

# VectorShop Intro

VectorShop is a vector design tool dedicated to making it easy for everyone to create stunning vector graphics. With a rich collection of built-in format presets, it allows one-click export to meet the requirements of various platforms. Specifically optimized for SF Symbols, it significantly boosts design efficiency.

## Basic Concepts

- *Curve*: *A single path that can be either closed or open. Rounded and smooth curves are anchor-based curves.*
- *Shape*: *Composed of multiple curves, ideal for creating complex graphics.*
- *Layer*: *Includes different layer types such as shapes, bitmap images, and text.*

## Key Features

### Toolset

Includes selection tool, pen tool, rounded curve tool, smooth curve tool, geometric shape tools (rectangle, circle, star, polygon, gear), and text tool.

### Curve Types

- **Bezier Curve**: Supports standard curve control, compatible with other vector software formats.
- **Rounded Corner Curve**: Allows adjusting corner radius on anchor points, ideal for creating smooth polygons.
- **Smooth Curve**: A Spline curve that enables smooth shapes and can convert each anchor point to a sharp corner.
- **Geometric Shapes**: Rectangle, circle, star, polygon, and gear, with customizable parameters to quickly create basic shapes.

### Anchor Curve Editing

- **Shortcut Keys**: Use C for smoothing, V for sharp corners, and X to merge anchors. These shortcuts are easy to remember as their shapes resemble the functions.
- **Snapping Logic**: Long-press C to snap to curves, V to snap to anchors, and X to snap to the grid. Shortcut letters resemble snapping targets, aiding memorization.
- **Local Editing**: Supports precise coordinate entry, edge extrusion, arc extrusion, and adding points with Command key.
- **Global Editing**: Includes horizontal, vertical, and rotational mirroring, curve offset, and matrix duplication via the context menu.
- **Precision Adjustment**: Move, rotate, and scale anchor points with precise input and customizable transformation centers.

### Shape Editing

- **Shape Composition**: Offers NonZero, Winding, Boolean, and SFSymbol rendering modes for combining shapes.
- **SFSymbol Creation**: Adjust stroke thickness and alignment with guide lines, then export as Apple-standard SFSymbols.
- **Fill Styles**: Supports 6 fill types—system colors, solid color, linear gradient, radial gradient, angular gradient, and image fill—with multiple overlay effects.
- **Stroke Properties**: Adjust thickness, position, join style (bevel, round, miter), and cap style (butt, round, square) to suit various design needs.

### Text Functionality

- Modify font, style, size (including system presets), alignment, size adjustment mode, line height, character spacing, and paragraph spacing.
- Supports importing and using custom fonts.
- Allows converting text layers into shape layers.

### Layer Effects

- **Drop Shadow**: Adjust color, distance, blur, and angle.
- **Inner Shadow**: Adjust color, distance, blur, and angle.

### Import and Export

- **Import Formats**: SVG, PNG, JPEG, and other image formats.
- **Image Export**: Options include cropping, border, fixed size, fixed ratio, and templates for iOS/Mac/Android app icons.
- **Code Export**: Export code compatible with SwiftUI, CAShapeLayer, and CGContext.

VectorShop combines robust functionality with user-friendly operation, making it an ideal choice for hobbyists, designers, and developers to efficiently create and develop vector graphics.
